About Parts, Part Assemblies, Part Instances
A part is an engineering representation of a physical part, and a part assembly is a group of
part assemblies and/or parts. Part Instances, which are recognized from PDM, are
automatically converted to Part Instances on import into HyperMesh.
Parts and Part Assemblies"
1,"Parts and Part Assemblies
HyperMesh supports CAE parts ( 
 ) and part assemblies ( 
 ) and PDM parts (
) and part assemblies ( 
 ).
Parts assemblies and parts facilitate the one-to-one mapping of a CAD hierarchy into the HyperMesh environment as
a CAE hierarchy. The CAE hierarchy can be created manually or can be imported from a PDM system via a neutral file
format such as PLMXML.
Figure 1. PDM BOM
Figure 2. HyperMesh BOM"
2,"Figure 1. PDM BOM
Figure 2. HyperMesh BOM
If a part is comprised of multiple components, such as cast parts or tailor-welded blanks, you can perform actions
such as visualization view modes, model management, and connector link definition at the part level.
Parts can be used to organize a physical part that is made up of multiple components in a CAE model as a single
part.

In the Part Browser, collapsing all folders at the part level enables you to see all owned and referenced entities.
Expanding folders at the part level displays a nested list of all referenced components and their entity specific
attribute values which are shown in the respective columns.
Part Instances"
4,"Part Instances
The Part browser provides limited support for part instances of externally sourced BOMs.
Part Instances (
) share UID and Part names. The name assigned to child instances is incremented by *.ixx, where
xx indicates the number of the child instance. The positioning of Part Instances is dictated by the transformation
matrix applied to the Part in the PDM system. Part Instances can also be created and broken interactively in a"
5,"session. Upon creation, you will automatically be prompted to transform the part via the Transform tool. When
broken, instances are split into two separate parts that are independent of each other.
In circular, symmetric, or rectangular patterns, certain parts may appear in a BOM multiple times. Typical examples
include bolts, hinges, and symmetric parts.
Creating or saving part representations for instantiated parts saves a single representation in the repository."
6,Importing instantiated parts positions them according to their respective 4 x 3 transformation matrices.

About Representations
The CAD representation is typically the original source of information of what a physical part
will look like. It forms the basis of the Common representation, which in turn is the basis of all
subsequent discipline specific mesh representations. A part can contain multiple
representations."
8,"representations.
Figure 1. Hierarchical Relationship of Representations
The Common representation component typically contains geometry, though it can also consist of FE mesh.
A folder based Representation repository stores all CAE data that is required during the model build and assembly
process. CAE data stored in the Representation repository includes the geometric and FE representation of the parts
that comprise the subsystem specific model hierarchy."
9,"You can import a BOM via a neutral file format such as PLMXML or manually create a part structure using the Part
Browser context menu.
Common Representation
The Common representation is derived from the CAD representation and forms the basis of all subsequent discipline
specific mesh representations.
For sheet metal parts, the Common representation consists of midsurfaced geometry or FE. The CAD is sent to the"
10,"BatchMesher for midsurface extraction; upon completion it is saved into the repository and you can elect to
immediately import the representation into the session."

HyperMesh entities are generated from the PDM metadata, if available, in the post-run procedure of the BatchMesh
operation. The PDM PID is assigned to the component and property, the PDM MID and PDM material is assigned to
the material and the PDM Thickness is assigned to the Thickness attribute of the property. If the PDM Thickness is"
12,"blank, the CAD Thickness calculated during the midsurface operation is automatically assigned to the Thickness
attribute of the property.
For parts such as castings and tailor-welded blanks, you can save CAD representations as Common models.
Alternatively, you can send solid parts to the BatchMesher. If thin-solid detection is enabled in the Common
representation parameter file, then solids will be detected and saved as the Common representation without"
13,"processing. By default, the midsurface algorithm skin is used. CAD representation does not need to be loaded into
the session in order to generate the Common representation since it is sent directly to the BatchMesher for
processing.
When you select a discipline specific mesh representation from the Change Representation dialog, Create tab, the
Common representation residing in the repository is automatically sent to the BatchMesher for processing. If the"
14,"Common representation does not exist it will be automatically generated.
Discipline Specific Mesh Representations
Common representations form the basis of all discipline specific representations. When you select a discipline
specific mesh representation from the Create Representation dialog, the Common representation residing in the
repository is automatically sent to the BatchMesher for processing. The Common representation does not need to"
15,"be loaded in the session to generate discipline specific mesh representations.

Fastener Realization Methods
Overview of the fastener connector realization process and methods.
The following flow chart outlines a four-stage process used to select the best routine for fastener realization.

Depending on the realization type, the mesh connectivity will automatically be assigned as independent or"
72,"dependent.
mesh independent
Use for realizations which do not need any mesh changes, and the connection is primarily defined via a solver-
specific card or the nodes which need to be connected are defined by a cylinder, such as Bolt (cylinder spring)
for Radioss.
For all mesh independent fastener realization types, a cylinder is defined. Fastener hole detection is not
performed because holes are not required. All of the nodes inside the cylinder are considered part of the"
73,"fastener realization unless they also belong to a link defined on the connector.

Therefore, the connector vector is essential for these types of realizations.
If a vector is not predefined and is determined dynamically, the vector will always point from the connector
position to the projection point on the farthest link.

Dynamic vectors have been used in the first two cylinder. Interchanging the values for L1 and L2 leads to very different"
76,"realizations. By comparison, the third cylinder uses the same values for L1 and L2 as in the second cylinder, but the result looks
better because of the predefined connector vector in the global z-direction.
In some automated processes, the cylinder diameter is automatically set to the fastener shaft diameter. This
leads to failed cylinder fasteners when the holes are properly modeled because the defined cylinder does not"
77,"contain nodes. In such cases, the cylinder diameter factor has been introduced; this factor is set to 1.0 by
default and is a multiplier for the cylinder diameter to increase the final cylinder diameter when necessary.
Note:  The cylinder diameter as well as the cylinder diameter factor can be reviewed and modified in the
Connector Browser. Connectors can also be rerealized with modified cylinder diameters and cylinder diameter"
78,factors without updating L1 or L2 in the browser. This is not possible from the panel.

1. For mesh dependent types, you must determine:
Is the existence of holes in each layer requested upfront?
How should the 2D mesh be prepared before the final realization is performed?
In the past, a fastener realization always required a hole for each layer in the initial mesh. This is no longer"
81,"necessary for 2D meshes because the imprint capability punches the needed holes into the mesh before the
final realization is performed, enabling the mesh to be manipulated in a pre-step. This makes it possible to
punch holes, move holes, close holes, create washers, and so on.
Under the Connectivity heading, select one of the following:
consider existing hole only
A minimum of one hole per layer must be available in the origin mesh. If holes do not exist, the"
82,"realization will fail. This is the default method and must be used for any type of solid meshes.
Figure 4.
create hole, if none
If there are not any holes on a certain layer, they will be punched into that layer at the position of the
projection point. The diameter of the new hole is defined under the Realization Details heading. This
method is used if the model does not contain the appropriate amount of holes per fastener, but holes
are required for specific realization types.
Figure 5."
83,"Figure 5.
use hole, if available
Creates hybrids (hole on one side only), but other combinations are allowed. On the mesh side (no
hole), the connection is realized via the head elements defined in the chosen realization type. The head
element(s) is/are created between the appropriate body element node and the nodes inside the
diameter (no hole connection dia) defined under the Realization Details heading. This option is used for
realization types which are not eager for holes.

Use this option when you do not want the shape of holes to interfere with the mesh flow in the fastener
region. The detected holes are closed and a remesh of the new elements and a few additional rows of
adjacent elements is performed. The connection is realized via the head elements defined in the chosen"
86,"realization type. The head elements are created between the appropriate body element nodes and the
nodes inside the diameter (no hole connection dia) defined under the Realization Details heading.
Figure 7.
Note:  The hole detection mechanism for the last three options takes into account a cylinder which is
defined under the Realization Details heading. The hole consideration cylinder option can be defined as a"
87,"factor of the no hole connection dia option or as an exact diameter. Principally holes which are inside or
touching the cylinder can be detected, but the hole consideration is reduced to one hole per link per
connector. Additionally, holes need to fit to the requested dimensions, which are also defined under the
Realization Details heading.
2. For the create hole, if none, and use hole options, a mesh modification including a hole movement is allowed."
88,"Therefore, you can determine whether to adjust the hole(s) or to adjust the realization.

During realization, if the mesh is altered to realize the connector, this option allows you to select
between ""Remesh"" and ""Rebuild"" meshing algorithms.
Rebuild Washer
Perform a rebuild operation on the created washer in cases where the washer is very close to a feature"
90,"edge. This will potentially change the shape of the washer to snap to feature edges to avoid poor mesh
quality.

FE Connectivity
(Spots Only)
For many FE config types, this option is pre-determined. But for some
types of weld representations, multiple configurations of connectivity
are valid. In such cases, you should select the type that is best for the
model. For example, a Nastran CWELD element is a mesh-independent"
109,"weld, which does not directly connect to the shell elements; depending
on how it was generated, plot elements are sometimes used to connect
the CWELD to the shells. In such situations, you should select option 2 -
mesh independent (head), rather than option 3. Depending on the FE
config selected, one or more connectivity types are valid.
Mesh dependent
Valid for weld elements that share
nodal connectivity with the
connecting shell parts.
Mesh independent

110,"(head)
Valid for weld elements that are
mesh-independent (do not share
nodal connectivity with the
connecting shell parts) but are
connected to the shell parts via
secondary entities (plot elements,
equations, and so on).
Mesh independent
(projs)
Valid for weld elements that are mesh
independent (do not share nodal
connectivity with the connecting shell
parts) and are not connected to the
shell parts in any way. Only their
projections fall on the shell elements.

position (Area Only)
Position and absorb area connectors into the middle of the hexa
adhesive realization. By default, this option is activated.
Consider single
element cluster
(Area Only)
Identify element clusters using certain rules during absorption. This
approach finds plane solid (hexas, pentas) element constellations which"
115,"are connected to 1D elements on two opposite sides. This option
provides better control of the identification of adhesives. The general
identification approach allows the creation of adhesive connectors even
from single elements, if all other rules are observed. Normally these
single elements should be absorbed into spots; this checkbox allows
you to also absorb single elements into an adhesive connector.
However, to prevent you from doing this by mistake, even when this"
116,"option is selected, it only becomes activated if all the selected 3D
elements belong to a unique component.
With tie contact
(Lines when set to
Solid Seams and
Areas)
Determine links by investigating tie contacts. Only entities that are part
of a tie contact will be considered for links.
Group links (Lines
when set to Solid
Seams and Areas)
During absorption, the top and bottom side of the solid connection is
identified. Combine all found links connected to the top side of the solid"
117,"connection into one group link and combine all found links connected
to the bottom side into a second group link.
When realizing a connector that is defined with group links, it is
guaranteed that at each test point valid projections for both group links
have to be found in order to have a successful connection. That
behavior encourages more reproducible results.
With head only
(Lines when set to
Solid Seams and
Areas)
Only consider solid connections with head elements for absorption."
118,"Tip:  It is recommended that you use this option in case you have
connections with heads, because it will lead to a better performance
and a safer link detection.
Clear this checkbox to also consider connections without head
elements. Link detection will rely on projections."

remesh
Connects the weld to the links using snap and split capabilities.

only ensures that the weld and the mesh have a proper node to node connection in the position
of the projection point."

quad transition
Creates perfectly shaped quad elements around the projection line. The quad size is determined
by the average mesh size. From one projection point to the next, exactly one pair of elements is
created. You can also use this option to create lines from quad elements and realize the
connections to the links through perfectly modeled t-edges.
For line quad transitions, the automatic snapping and feature detection option, Allow Snapping,"
159,"is activated. This prevents the creation of elements that are too small and ensures that the
geometry is not modified too much."

Free edges and features with an angle greater than 25° are always taken into account. If smaller
feature angles should be considered, decrease the value in the Feature Angle field under the
Behavior heading. Feature angles smaller than 5° will not be considered at all."
161,"By default, snapping is allowed by a distance of one third of the quad pattern element size. In the
case of a predefined quad pattern element size of 10.0, the outer nodes can snap to features in a
distance of 3.3. The algorithm also tries to snap all three nodes of a quad pattern or none.
Adjust Realization
find nearest nodes
Searches for the nearest nodes within the given tolerance, making it possible to connect t-joints"
162,"and similar areas. This option is very useful in situations where the connectors are not positioned
perfectly. These realizations are allowed to be non-normal.
Find nearest nodes does not do any projection.
Note:  If the connector points are close to each other and two of these points find the same
closest nodes, the connector fails.

project and find nodes
Requires a valid projection onto the link entities in the first step. In the second step the nodes"
163,"closest to the projection points will be used for the connection. If a projection (connector
tolerance) is not possible, the realization fails. Because a non-normal projection for lines is
always allowed, the results will be exactly the same as the results for find nearest node.
Note:  The realization fails when the connector points are close to each other, and two of
these points find the same nodes."

match the results to create a final result that is seamless and properly meshed.
The option Resolve Conflicts is activated by default, enabling smaller imprint conflicts to be
automatically resolved when connectors are realized. Overlapping elements are released, and a normal
remesh of that area is performed as long as the overlapping area is smaller than half the regular quad

Meshing parts individually is always recommended. When there are multiple instances of the same part, it is

ensure that the part geometry that is meshed has the mesh stored in its original component.

A right-click on Model allows a selection option to make the root model current. With the root model set as"
262,"current, any surface, set, contact/tie, boundary conditions created using the Model Browser, panel, or any
specific workflow tools like the Contact Browser creates entities in Assembly (outside of instances) or at root
model (outside of Assembly) where it is relevant for the entity to remain.
Analysis setup
All the analysis conditions are a part of model level data (after *END ASSEMBLY). The corresponding model is"
263,"set as current. Further, loads and boundary conditions can be created through panels with a load collector
created for their use in the Model Browser. The Contact Browser is available to set up contact/tie between
mating parts or components. Tie constraints created using the Contact Browser ensure that the keyword is
placed at the Assembly level, as per the solver requirement. The analysis step can be defined using the"
264,"loadstep manager. All these entities can also be created through the Model Browser or Solver Browser.
Similarly, all other entities, such as output blocks and group entities like control cards, model change, contact
interference, and so on can be created in the Model Browser or Solver Browser and can be appropriately
chosen for a defined loadstep.

During the realization, the solver-specific connection is created. For example, for the Nastran CWELD of

remesh
Takes the projection points into account and uses snap and split capabilities to connect the weld
to the links.
quad transition
Creates perfectly shaped quad elements around the projection points. By default, the quad size"
289,"is determined by the average mesh size. Alternatively, you can specify a specific quad size in the
Quad Size field.
For point quad transition, the automatic snapping and feature detection option, Allow Snapping,
is activated. This prevents the creation of elements that are too small and ensures that the
geometry is not modified too much.
Free edges and features with an angle greater than 25° are always taken into account. If smaller"
290,"feature angles should be considered, decrease the value in the Feature Angle field under the
Behavior heading. Feature angles smaller than 5° will not be considered at all.
By default, snapping is allowed by a distance of one third of the quad pattern element size. In the
case of a predefined quad pattern element size of 10.0, the outer nodes can snap to features in a
distance of 3.3. The algorithm also tries to snap all three nodes of a quad pattern or none."

In Figure 2, points were created at the same exact position, though there is a notable difference.
In both images, the connectors have been created along a line, but in the left image the split to
points option was enabled.
Therefore, in the left image, the quad transition pattern is aligned to the mesh; in the right"
294,"image, the quad transition pattern is oriented along the point connector line. All elements
around the point connector line belong to the regular pattern. The number of element pairs
created along the point connector line between the point positions depends on the average or
selected mesh size, which can range from one to many. The quad elements are distributed
equidistant along the line.
In curved regions the inner and outer lengths of the element edges differ.
