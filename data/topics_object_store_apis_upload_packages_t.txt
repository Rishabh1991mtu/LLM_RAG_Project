 Apply the Object Store Packages Apply the Object Store API packages created to the local UI framework. Before you begin, ensure that you have the following packages: Python (WHL file) or NodeJS (tar.gz) package. For example, the ToDo package (altair-todo-version.tgz) that is created Altair System package (altair-system-version.tgz) located at <objectstore location>/<version>/js/ The following steps must be performed to use the Object Store packages: Copy the Object Store and Altair System Packages to the local web workspace Update the Application framework Install the packages Copy the Object Store and Altair System packages to the local web workspace. Upload Packages Update the package.json file to include the copied packages and the application framework. { "name": "todo", "version": "0.1.0", "private": true, "dependencies": { "@altair/a365-themes": "^2.1.0", "@altair/app-frame": "^6.3.2", "@altair/react-hooks": "^2.2.0", "@altair/system": "./packages/altair-system-1.0.276.tgz", "@altair/todo": "./packages/altair-todo-1.0.0.tgz", "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.1", "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.2", "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0", "bootstrap": "^5.1.3", "nats.ws": "^1.5.0", "react": "^17.0.2", "react-app-rewired": "^2.2.1", "react-bootstrap": "^2.1.0", "react-dom": "^17.0.2", "react-modal": "^3.15.1", "react-scripts": "5.0.0", "react-select": "^5.2.1", "uuid": "^8.3.2", "web-vitals": "^2.1.2" }, "devDependencies": { "@altair/prettier-rules": "^2.0.1", "@altair/react-dev-proxy": "^3.0.1", "cross-env": "^5.2.1" }, "scripts": { "start": "cross-env GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false REACT_APP_PROXIES=local react-app-rewired start", "build": "react-app-rewired build", "test": "react-app-rewired test", "eject": "react-app-rewired eject" }, "eslintConfig": { "extends": [ "react-app", "react-app/jest" ] }, "browserslist": { "production": [ ">0.2%", "not dead", "not op_mini all" ], "development": [ "last 1 chrome version", "last 1 firefox version", "last 1 safari version" ] }} The included application framework provides the login page, authentication, authorization, and notifications required to use the web portal. Update the index.js file to use the application framework: import React from 'react';import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';import AppFrame from '@altair/app-frame';import './index.css';const App = React.lazy(() => import('./App'));ReactDOM.render( <AppFrame appNames={['Todo']} defaultAppName="Todo" config={{ notification: { enabled: true }, waffleMenuFavoriteAppsEnabled: true }}> <App appName="Todo" /> </AppFrame>, document.getElementById('root')); Install the packages to the UI framework based on the node package manager that is used. For example, use the following command to install the package: yarn install This will detect and install all the packages in node modules defined in the package.json. Next step is to use the Object Store content definitions in the application framework.
