Executing Solve The following code is used for executing the solver:memory = { "value": 3750, "valueWithUnits": "3750 MiB", "normalizedValue": 3932160000}ncpu = 2version = "2022.2"options = ActionExecOptions(metadata={"queueType": "implicit"}, execEnv="Jobs")optistructJobAction = await (modelFile.solve(memory=memory, ncpu=ncpu, version=version, execOptions=options)) You can achieve this in the UI using View Definition file: The contents of the Job directory will have the result files once the job is complete.
